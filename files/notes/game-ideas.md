Robot Scavenging Game
- In an abandoned / run down world
- You play as a robot scavenging ruined buildings / places
- Other robots can sell you items and upgrades in exchange for scrape
- However both the player and NPCs have limited power reserves
- The player will sometimes need to share their own HP / Power with the NPCs to prevent them from going offline
- Scavenging is a risk-reward / push your luck turn based system.
    - Pushing deeper into a level may reward the player with scrap and items, but they may also use their power and find nothing.
    - Traps / Perils
    - Shortcut doors
- If the player runs out of power, that robot is lost and the player takes control of a new base level robot.
    - Upgrade home base maybe raises the level of said new robots?
